  "course_description": "Great works of fiction often take us to far-off places; they sometimes conduct us on journeys toward a deeper understanding of what's right next door. We'll read, discuss, and interpret a range of short and short-ish works: The reading list will be chosen from among such texts as \"Gilgamesh,\" Homer's _Odyssey_ (excerpts), Bunyan's _The_ _Pilgrim's Progress_ (excerpts), Swift's _Gulliver's Travels_, Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_, Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_, Saleh's _Season of Migration to the North_, Woolf's _To the Lighthouse_, John Cheever's \"The Swimmer,\" Coetzee's _The Life and Times of Michael K_, Irving's \"Rip Van Winkle,\" Toni Morrison's _Jazz_, H. G. Wells' _The Time Machine_, Twain's _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_, Beckett's _How It Is_, Calvino's _Invisible Cities_, Forster's _A Passage to India_. As a CI-H class, this subject will involve substantial practice in argumentative writing and oral communication.\n",
