Assessment of Writing
---------------------

I expect written work of the same caliber as the work required in your other MIT subjects. This means carefully composed and proof-read (no sloppy errors), thorough, well thought-out, sufficiently supplied with supporting material quoted or paraphrased from the text(s).

In reading your work, I do not distinguish between "content" and "style" or "quality of writing." How you decide to state something, how you assemble an argument, how you construct each and every sentence—these things _constitute_ your argument and are indistinguishable from its "content."

Oral Reports
------------

At the beginning of the term I will circulate a list of topics suitable for reports of no more than 5 minutes in length; each student will choose one topic for the first of your two reports. Your job will be to inform your classmates as clearly and concisely as possible about various historical, literary, and cultural matters that can aid understanding of the works we're covering. You should be able to find all the information you need by means of a brief internet search or by consulting reference materials in the Humanities Library.

I will grade you both on the accuracy and usefulness of the information you present as well as on your presentation style, which should not be too slangy and informal. I will be looking to see if you have prioritized the information you found so as to present what is most pertinent to our concerns in the class.

Advice on Oral Reports:
-----------------------

1.  Have a prepared outline or text to speak from, but …
2.  Don't just read out a text; make eye contact with your audience and talk _to_ it.
3.  Rehearse and time your presentation in advance.
4.  Convey your information to the other students, not just to me.
5.  Prepare powerpoint slides or provide handouts showing unfamiliar names or terms, maps, etc.
6.  If you use powerpoint, don't just read out to the audience the exact same words that appear on the slides. We can read! The slides should provide the skeleton of your report, not the entire substance.

And For the Audience:
---------------------

Since everyone will be presenting and it will thus be your turn eventually, be respectful to the student reporting, pay attention, take notes, and show some appreciation for the effort that has gone into the presentation.
